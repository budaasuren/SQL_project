# World-Health-Organization-diet-dataset-analysis-
Using the employeesâ€™ data, designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then completed Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this project, I have cleaned the raw data of diet from The World Health Organization's website using PostgreSQL and then transformed the cleaned data for the purpose of the analysis. Also, I have created data schema for relational database.

Tools/Languages : ETL, Relational Database, Table Schema, PostgreSQL
